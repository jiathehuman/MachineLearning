# Machine Learning
This directory contains some of my machine learning and data science projects.

## ðŸ’¸ 1. Predicting Default of Credit Cards 
This is a project done in fulfilment of CM3015 Machine Learning and Neural Networks module. The purpose of this project is to find the best Machine Learning (ML) model for the classification task of determining whether a customer will default on the payment of credit card. The dataset used, named 'Default of Credit Card Clients' is acquired from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

### This project includes
- Data pre-processing with scaling and removing outliers
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Building Machine Learning algorithms (k-NN, NaÃ¯ve Bayes and Logistic Regression) from scratch, purely with NumPy
- Cross Validation
- Feature engineering with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), T-SNE, Polynomial Features and RFE.

This project is done in fulfilment of CM3015 (Machine Learning and Neural Networks) midterm coursework.

## ðŸš— 2. Predicting Car Prices with Linear Regression 
This is a project done in fulfilment of CM3005 Data Science module. This project focuses on price anaysis of new and used cars. This project is motivated by the assymetry of information within the used car market, where prices of cars are not immediately transparent to consumers. This project aims to create a linear regression model that can accurately predict prices of used cars. An accurate model can objectively determine a car's price based on its attributes, and provide buyers with a baseline of how much they should actually pay for a used car.

### This project includes
- Data preparation (Data exploration, imputation of missing data, label-encoding
- Dealing with Multicollinearity
- Statical Analysis
- Visualisation with Seaborn library
- Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn
- Validation
- Feature Engineering
- Regularisation
- Evaluation of models
